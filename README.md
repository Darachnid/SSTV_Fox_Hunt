# Wildlife Monitoring Using SSTV and Ham Radio

## Project Overview
This project aims to combine the technologies of Slow-Scan Television (SSTV) and ham radio to create a unique wildlife monitoring system. By integrating these technologies with wildlife cameras, the project seeks to enable remote transmission of wildlife images over ham radio frequencies. This approach offers a novel way to monitor wildlife in remote areas, contributing to wildlife research and conservation efforts.

### Core Concept
- Utilize wildlife cameras to capture images of wildlife.
- Integrate SSTV encoders to convert these images into audio signals.
- Use ham radio transmitters to send these audio signals over specific frequencies.
- Receive the transmitted signals at a location using a ham radio receiver.
- Decode the signals back into images for monitoring and analysis.

### Goals
- To provide a remote, real-time monitoring solution for wildlife observation.
- To minimize human interference in wildlife habitats.
- To leverage amateur radio technology for ecological research and conservation.

### Potential Impact
This integration promises a unique and effective tool for ecologists, conservationists, and amateur radio enthusiasts, bridging technology with nature conservation.
